CogniSwitch.ai is dedicated to making generative AI technology easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users. Our mission is to simplify the development pipeline for generative AI applications, reduce implementation times, and lower costs. We achieve this by automating the development process and providing all the necessary tools for building reliable AI applications.  

At the core of our platform is the state-of-the-art Fusion RAG (Fusion - Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology, which enhances the reliability, security, and accuracy of generative AI. CogniSwitch.ai follows an Ingestion-Curation-Provision (ICP) structure explained below. 

### I for Ingestion of Knowledge Sources:
Sources can be any of the following:
1. Documents in formats like PDF, DOCX, HTML, XML, PPTX, XLSX, TXT
2. URLs of websites / webpages
3. Records from Systems of Record like JIRA, ServiceNOW etc
4. Conversations from Systems of Engagement like emails, Slack, Discord, MS Teams etc
   
We ensure that data is efficiently gathered and processed for AI applications. 

### C for Curation of Knowledge Assets: 
Once the ingestion phase is complete, we allow Human-in-the-Loop Feedback for Knowledge that was extracted, generated & organized from sources. Edits can be made to Knowledge Assets before being published.
    
### P for Provision of Knowledge:
Post the curation phase, these knowledge assets are now ready to be used in AI application use-cases like Question Answering, Recommendations, Summaries etc
